Combine cheese sauce with cooked pasta.
Transfer half of the mac and cheese to a baking dish, sprinkle with more shredded cheese.

Tips:
Boiling the pasta – cook the pasta less than you normally would.  I like to boil my elbow pasta for between 4 and 5 minutes.  
The pasta will continue to cook in the oven, and you don’t want it to get mushy.
Use room temp liquids – if you can… cold liquids generally take longer to thicken than warmer ones. 
I usually set my milk and half and half out while the water for the pasta is coming up to a boil.
The cheeses – use your favorites!  Our personal favorites are the cheddar and gruyere used in this recipe,
but you can be very creative with the cheese selection here.  
Mozzarella, gouda, smoked gouda, swiss, monterey jack, colby jack, colby.  
There are plenty of reader comments down below the recipe that talk about the cheeses they used!
Shred your own – I know it’s a pain, and it’s SO tempting to use the pre-shredded cheese in the bags. 
But those bags of cheese contain a starchy substance that keeps the cheese from clumping… 
which also prohibits it from melting as well as it should.
